A blog creation and maintaining site
Blog, also known as Web log or Weblog, is an online diary maintained by an individual, a group of people, or an organisation. Some blogs serve primarily as news aggregators, gathering information from numerous web sources and adding succinct remarks and hyperlinks. Other blogs focus on showcasing original content. Additionally, a lot of blogs offer a forum where readers can discuss and engage with the author. Writing content for a blog is referred to as "blogging." Even though written content predominates, many blogs also include substantial visual, aural, and video components. The online community of blogs is known as the "blogosphere". Our project focuses on personal blogs which acts as a daily personal journal without any judgment from the external sources and provides a safe environment to the user. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98581350/198499399-453a1727-f5de-4b38-aa0e-e8cebb2af469.png)
